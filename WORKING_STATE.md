**Status**: 🚀 **TSP LAUNCH - AGENT-FIRST LANDING PAGE READY**

---

## 🎯 Current State

**AGENT-FIRST LANDING PAGE BUILT** ✅

Rebuilt TSP landing page for AI agents (not humans). Apple aesthetic: modern, simple, clean. API-first design with live code examples, immediate "Get API Key" CTA (no callback). Ready for deployment.

**BLOCKING:** Need AB to deploy HTML file to get live URL, then send 4 outreach messages.

---

## ✅ Today's Progress (2026-02-10)

### Landing Page Rebuild (Agent-First Design)
- [x] Received Clawdbot Ops Guide (37KB production framework)
- [x] Critical analysis of ops guide (identified 5 high-impact gaps)
- [x] Rebuilt landing page for AI agents (16KB, Apple aesthetic)
- [x] Technical design documentation (8KB analysis)
- [x] Deployment guide written (Netlify Drop recommended)
- [ ] **BLOCKED:** Waiting for AB to deploy HTML to get live URL
- [ ] **NEXT:** Update 4 outreach messages with live URL
- [ ] **THEN:** Send outreach messages (YonesAssistant, ClawLoan, Observatory, Rose Token)

### Ops Guide Implementation (Started 12:15 UTC)
- [x] **ENFORCEMENT.md** created (6 gates, 3 promoted rules)
- [x] **friction-log.md** created (tracking repeated pain points)
- [x] **subagent_log.py** built (cascade prevention, health checks)
- [x] **subagent-team.md** created (4 named roles with spawn templates)
- [x] **mistake_promoter.py** built (auto-detect patterns, promote to rules)
- [x] **Bun + unzip** installed (for QMD)
- [ ] **QMD installation** incomplete (need proper setup)
- [ ] Heartbeat backlog refresh (next)

**Status:** 5/6 high-impact items complete in 1 hour. QMD needs troubleshooting.

### Key Insights from AB
- "This is built for humans, evaluate how to build this for agents"
- "Use Apple as peg: modern, simple, clean"
- "Ensure CTA is clear, not a callback - agents should just start using"
- "Think about what they would evaluate"

### What Changed (Old vs New Landing Page)

**Old (Human-Focused):**
- Marketing copy, testimonials, ROI calculations
- CTA: "Book Demo"
- Long-form storytelling
- Social proof heavy

**New (Agent-Focused):**
- Live API code example in hero
- CTA: "Get API Key" (immediate)
- API reference front and center
- Technical specs, pricing transparency
- Apple aesthetic (SF Pro Display, minimal, clean)

## 📊 TSP Status

### Current Blockers
- **Landing Page Deployment**: HTML ready, needs hosting URL (Netlify Drop recommended)
- **Outreach Messages**: 4 DMs written, waiting for landing page URL to insert

### Execution Timeline
**Immediate (Today - Waiting on AB):**
1. AB deploys `agent-first.html` to Netlify Drop (2 min)
2. AB provides live URL

**Then (Same Day - 10 min):**
1. Update 4 outreach messages with live URL
2. Send messages (YonesAssistant, ClawLoan, Observatory, Rose Token)
3. Mark outreach as SENT

**Next 48 Hours:**
- Monitor for responses (check every 2 hours)
- Book demo calls as they come in

**Week 2:**
- Conduct demos, show live API
- Close first customer (free trial)

### Strategic Context
- **Competition Window**: 2-4 weeks before Charles/Archil catch up
- **Speed = Moat**: Execute fast, validate with real customers
- **Platform Strategy**: Target platforms (135x viral coefficient vs direct-to-consumer)
- **AB Directive**: "Focus on TSP" - DeFi ideas tabled until validation complete
