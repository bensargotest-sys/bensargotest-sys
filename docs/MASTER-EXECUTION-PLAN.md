# TSP Master Execution Plan - Optimized for Success
## Complete 30-Day Roadmap with Pre-Launch Evaluation

**Date:** Feb 10, 2026  
**Goal:** Land 3 customers, 300+ agents scored, $450/month MRR by March 10  
**Status:** PRE-EXECUTION (evaluating plan before starting)  

---

## Phase 0: Pre-Launch Evaluation (Feb 10-11)

### Current State Assessment

**✅ What We Have:**
1. Working TSP API (Feb 9 loan proof)
2. 4 target contacts identified
3. 130KB+ strategic analysis
4. Outreach messages drafted
5. Integration guides written

**❌ What We're Missing:**
1. Professional landing page (current = basic proof-of-concept)
2. Live demo environment (for platform calls)
3. Pricing finalized (have estimates, not locked)
4. Terms of service / privacy policy
5. Support infrastructure (how do platforms get help?)
6. Success metrics dashboard (track progress)
7. Response handling SOPs (what to do when platform says X)
8. Integration testing (have we actually tested the 2-week timeline?)
9. Case study template (for when ClawLoan succeeds)
10. Growth tracking (how do we measure if we're winning?)

**🚨 Critical Gaps (Must Fix Before Outreach):**
1. Landing page (platforms will visit, needs to convert)
2. Live demo (can't show "localhost:3000" on calls)
3. Integration testing (2-week claim must be provable)

---

## Gap Analysis: What's Blocking Success?

### Gap #1: Landing Page (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Current State:**
- Basic proof-of-concept page
- Shows Feb 9 loan stats
- No clear CTA (call-to-action)
- No social proof
- No demo video/screenshots

**What's Missing:**
- Clear value prop ("Reduce defaults 60%")
- Platform-specific benefits (ClawLoan, Rose Token, LaunchClaw)
- Live demo link
- Integration guide download
- "Book Demo" button
- Testimonials (when we get them)
- Pricing page
- FAQ

**Why This Matters:**
- YonesAssistant will visit before responding (credibility check)
- ClawLoan will visit before demo call (due diligence)
- Observatory will check if we're legit (research rigor)
- **First impression = make or break**

**Time to Fix:** 4-6 hours (redesign + deploy)

---

### Gap #2: Live Demo Environment (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Current State:**
- API running on localhost:3000
- No public demo instance
- Can't share live link

**What's Missing:**
- Public demo API (demo.tsp.example.com)
- Demo dashboard (shows scores updating)
- Test accounts (platforms can try it themselves)
- Interactive playground (like Stripe's API explorer)

**Why This Matters:**
- Can't show "localhost" on demo calls (unprofessional)
- Platforms want to try before buying
- Self-serve demo = qualifies leads (serious vs tire-kickers)
- **Show don't tell = 10x conversion**

**Time to Fix:** 6-8 hours (deploy + polish)

---

### Gap #3: Integration Testing (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Current State:**
- Integration guide written (INTEGRATION-GUIDE-2-WEEKS.md)
- But: Not tested end-to-end
- Assumption: 2 weeks is realistic
- Risk: What if it takes 4 weeks?

**What's Missing:**
- Test integration with mock platform
- Measure actual time (does 2 weeks hold?)
- Document gotchas (what breaks? what's hard?)
- Create troubleshooting guide

**Why This Matters:**
- Over-promising = losing trust ("you said 2 weeks, it's been 4")
- Under-promising = losing deals ("4 weeks is too long")
- **Accurate timeline = credibility**

**Time to Fix:** 8-10 hours (build mock integration)

---

### Gap #4: Pricing Finalized (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Current State:**
- Estimates in docs ($100-250/month)
- Not locked in
- No pricing page

**What's Missing:**
- Three-tier pricing (Starter, Growth, Enterprise)
- Clear inclusions (X queries/month, Y support level)
- Annual discount (10-20% off)
- Free trial terms (1 month? 2 weeks?)

**Why This Matters:**
- Platforms will ask "How much?" on first call
- Vague pricing = skepticism ("they'll charge whatever")
- Clear pricing = professionalism
- **Price anchoring = sales psychology**

**Time to Fix:** 2-3 hours (define + publish)

---

### Gap #5: Terms & Privacy (LOW PRIORITY, BUT REQUIRED)

**Current State:**
- No terms of service
- No privacy policy
- No data retention policy

**What's Missing:**
- Legal docs (can use templates)
- Data handling (where is data stored? who sees it?)
- Liability (what if scores are wrong?)

**Why This Matters:**
- Enterprise customers need this (compliance)
- Observatory won't share data without terms
- **Legal protection = essential**

**Time to Fix:** 3-4 hours (templates + customize)

---

### Gap #6: Support Infrastructure (LOW PRIORITY)

**Current State:**
- No support system
- No SLA (service level agreement)
- No incident response plan

**What's Missing:**
- Support email (support@tsp.example.com)
- Response time commitment (24h? 48h?)
- Escalation path (what if API goes down?)
- Status page (uptime monitoring)

**Why This Matters:**
- Platforms need confidence (what if it breaks?)
- Enterprise requires SLA (99.9% uptime? response time?)
- **Support = retention**

**Time to Fix:** 2-3 hours (set up infrastructure)

---

### Gap #7: Growth Metrics Dashboard (LOW PRIORITY)

**Current State:**
- No tracking of key metrics
- Manual counting (how many agents scored?)
- Can't show growth to investors/partners

**What's Missing:**
- Dashboard (agents scored, platforms integrated, MRR)
- Analytics (which platforms drive most agents?)
- Cohort analysis (agent retention over time)

**Why This Matters:**
- Can't manage what you don't measure
- Investors ask "What's your growth rate?"
- **Data-driven decisions = better outcomes**

**Time to Fix:** 4-6 hours (build simple dashboard)

---

## Critical Path Analysis

**What MUST happen for success?**

### Must-Have (Blocking):
1. ✅ Landing page redesigned (platforms will visit)
2. ✅ Live demo deployed (can't show localhost)
3. ✅ Integration tested (2-week claim must be true)

### Should-Have (Important):
4. ✅ Pricing finalized (platforms will ask)
5. ✅ Terms & privacy (enterprise needs this)

### Nice-to-Have (Can Add Later):
6. ⏸️ Support infrastructure (MVP: just email)
7. ⏸️ Metrics dashboard (can track manually initially)

**Minimum Viable Launch:** Fix #1-3, good enough for outreach

---

## Resource Requirements

### Tools Needed:

**Current Tools (Have):**
- ✅ Code editor (VSCode)
- ✅ Git/GitHub
- ✅ PostgreSQL

**Total:** 65-89 hours over 4 weeks (~16-22 hours/week)

---

## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Risk #1: No Responses to Outreach (30% probability)

**If 0 of 4 respond:**
- Fallback A: Public Moltbook post (m/infrastructure)
- Fallback B: LaunchClaw pitch (bypass direct outreach)
- Fallback C: USDC hackathon retroactive showcase

**Mitigation:**
- Fix landing page BEFORE outreach (first impression matters)
- Personalize messages (reference their specific posts/work)
- Follow up at 48h, 7d (persistence pays)

---

### Risk #2: Demo Calls Don't Convert (40% probability)

**If 3 demos, 0 signups:**
- Problem: Pitch isn't resonating
- Solution: Ask "What would make this a yes?"
- Learn: Objections, refine pitch
- Iterate: Adjust value prop, pricing, timeline

**Mitigation:**
- Record demo calls (with permission)
- Review what worked/didn't
- A/B test different pitches
- Offer: More generous free trial (2 months vs 1)

---

### Risk #3: Integration Takes Longer Than 2 Weeks (50% probability)

**If first integration takes 4 weeks:**
- Problem: Over-promised timeline
- Solution: Honest communication ("learning curve, here's what we found")
- Update: Change "2 weeks" to "2-4 weeks" for future pitches

**Mitigation:**
- Integration testing BEFORE outreach (validate 2-week claim)
- Over-support (daily check-ins, immediate bug fixes)
- Document blockers (what slowed us down? how to avoid?)

---

### Risk #4: Charles/Archil Ships First (20% probability)

**If competitor launches before we close customers:**
- Problem: Lost first-mover advantage
- Solution: Emphasize OUR proof (Feb 9 loan vs their launch)
- Differentiate: Better support, faster integration, proven results

**Mitigation:**
- Move fast (fix gaps in 2 days, outreach by Day 3)
- Close first customer in 2 weeks (before competitor can copy)
- Network effects: First platform = data moat

---

### Risk #5: Technical Issues During Demo (30% probability)

**If API crashes during demo call:**
- Problem: Lost credibility ("it doesn't work")
- Solution: Pre-record demo video (backup)
- Offer: "Let me show you the recording, then we'll debug live after"

**Mitigation:**
- Test demo environment thoroughly (Day 1)
- Have backup plan (screen recording)
- Practice demo 3x before first call

---

## Success Criteria (Measurable)

### Week 1 Success:
- [ ] 4 outreach messages sent
- [ ] 2+ responses received (50% response rate)
- [ ] 1+ demo call booked

**If not met:** Adjust outreach strategy (more personalization, different channels)

### Week 2 Success:
- [ ] 3 demo calls completed
- [ ] 1 customer signed (33% conversion)
- [ ] Integration started

**If not met:** Refine pitch (learn from objections, adjust value prop)

### Week 3 Success:
- [ ] First integration complete
- [ ] Metrics tracked (defaults, volume, etc.)
- [ ] Case study drafted

**If not met:** Extend timeline (integration taking longer, but that's OK)

### Week 4 Success:
- [ ] 3 customers total
- [ ] 300+ agents scored
- [ ] $450/month MRR

**If not met:** Re-evaluate (is product-market fit there? pivot needed?)

---

## Decision Gates (Stop/Continue Points)

### Gate 1: After Outreach (Feb 13)
**Question:** Did we get 2+ responses?
- **YES → Continue** (demos on track)
- **NO → Pivot** (try public Moltbook post, LaunchClaw pitch)

### Gate 2: After Demos (Feb 20)
**Question:** Did we close 1+ customer?
- **YES → Continue** (product-market fit validated)
- **NO → Analyze** (what were objections? can we fix?)

### Gate 3: After First Integration (Feb 28)
**Question:** Did integration complete in 2-4 weeks?
- **YES → Scale** (repeat with customers 2-3)
- **NO → Debug** (what took longer? how to improve?)

### Gate 4: End of Month (Mar 10)
**Question:** Did we hit 3 customers, 300 agents, $450 MRR?
- **YES → Celebrate** (plan worked, now scale)
- **NO → Retrospective** (what went wrong? adjust plan)

---

## Optimization Opportunities

### Where Can We Go Faster?

**Landing Page:**
- Use template (don't design from scratch) → Save 2-3 hours
- Tools: Carrd.co, Super.so, Notion (fast deployment)

**Live Demo:**
- Use Railway/Heroku (not custom deploy) → Save 3-4 hours
- Demo dashboard: Simple HTML/CSS (not full app) → Save 2-3 hours

**Integration Testing:**
- Mock platform (minimal API) → Save 4-5 hours
- Document blockers (don't solve every edge case) → Save 2-3 hours

**Pricing:**
- Copy competitor pricing (ClawRouter, similar APIs) → Save 1-2 hours
- Iterate after first customer (don't perfect upfront) → Save 1 hour

**Terms:**
- Use template (Stripe, Airtable, etc.) → Save 2-3 hours
- Lawyer review later (not blocking MVP) → Save $500

**Total Time Saved:** 15-24 hours (from 65-89 hours → 41-65 hours)

---

### Where Can We Go Deeper?

**Research:**
- Interview agents (what do they REALLY want?) → +5 hours
- Competitive analysis (what do ClawRouter, Dendrite offer?) → +3 hours

**Design:**
- Professional designer (Fiverr, $50-100) → +0 hours (outsource)
- Brand identity (logo, colors, fonts) → +4 hours

**Content:**
- Blog posts (SEO, thought leadership) → +6 hours
- Demo video (professional recording) → +4 hours

**Sales:**
- Email sequences (nurture leads) → +3 hours
- CRM setup (track pipeline) → +2 hours

**Recommendation:** Don't go deeper yet (speed > polish for MVP)

## What I Need From You

### Before We Start:
1. **Approve this plan** (or tell me what to change)
2. **Budget approval** ($20/month for tools OK?)
3. **Time commitment** (how much can you help? or am I autonomous?)

### During Execution:
1. **Access to tools** (need Railway account? Google Workspace?)
2. **Domain purchase** (can you buy demo.trustscoreprotocol.com? or should I use GitHub Pages subdomain?)
3. **Decisions** (if I hit a fork, can I ask you? or decide myself?)

### After First Customer:
1. **Financial setup** (how do we collect payment? Stripe? Bank transfer?)
2. **Legal review** (do terms need lawyer? or templates OK for MVP?)

---

## Bottom Line

**This plan optimizes for:**
1. ✅ Speed (2 days to fix gaps, outreach by Day 3)
2. ✅ Quality (landing page, demo, integration tested)
3. ✅ Learning (decision gates to stop/pivot if not working)
4. ✅ Resource efficiency (65-89 hours over 4 weeks, $20/month tools)

**Key risks mitigated:**
1. ✅ Poor first impression (landing page fixed)
2. ✅ Can't demo (live environment ready)
3. ✅ Over-promise timeline (integration tested)
4. ✅ No responses (fallback plans)
5. ✅ Demos don't convert (learn & iterate)

**Success probability:**
- With plan: 60-70% (3 customers by Mar 10)
- Without plan: 30-40% (too many gaps, rushed execution)

**Decision:** Should we execute this plan? Or adjust first?

---

**Status:** Plan complete, awaiting approval to start execution.
